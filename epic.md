Two men go camping in the woods.

In the middle of the night a drop-bear attacks the camp and greviously wounds one man before the other manages to shoot the beast.

As the creature scampers off into the night the man looks down at his blood soaked friend and calls 000, "my friend has been killed by a ravenous drop-bear, what do I do?".

The operator responds, "Calm down, I can help. 

First, let's make sure he's dead." 

There is a silence; then a gun shot is heard. 

The man returns to the phone, "OK, now what?"
